# Kaggle Facial Keypoints Detection

Facial keypoints labeling is an important and challenging problem in computer vision. At inference time, we would like to take as input the pixel representation of an image of a face, and output the locations of various landmarks, including the position on and around the eye and lips, and the tip of the nose.

The ability to accurately label these locations enables numerous downstream applications. These include facial recognization, analysis of facial expressions, detecting dysmorphic facial signs for medical diagnosis, biometrics, and facial tracking in videos. For example, the analysis of facial expressions can be done by measuring the shape of the lips, where curving up might represent a smiles and curving down might represent a frown. This analysis could be important for classifying true customer satisfaction of a transaction at a retail store or a driver's mood in a car.

Detecing facial keypoints is a very challenging problem. Computer vision research has come a long way in addressing these difficulties, but there remain many opportunities for improvement. The variability of facial features from individual to individual, the diversity in angles from which pictures are taken, and the scale of the facial image with respect to the rest of the picture are three challenges that make accurate labeling difficult in practice. 

The goal of this project is develop a machine learning model to address this problem, including the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks. We show results of our submissions on the Kaggle website. Link the (ended) competition is below:
